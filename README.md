## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Commands

Add new commands by modifying the workflow:

1. Add condition node for new command
2. Create Google Drive operation
3. Format response message
4. Connect to audit logging

### Security Enhancements

- Add webhook authentication
- Implement user access controls
- Set up rate limiting
- Configure deletion confirmations

### Scaling

- Use n8n cloud for production
- Implement queue management
- Add error notifications
- Set up monitoring

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Webhook not receiving messages**
- Check Twilio webhook URL configuration
- Verify n8n is accessible from internet
- Test webhook endpoint manually

**2. Google Drive access denied**
- Verify OAuth2 credentials
- Check API scopes (drive.file, drive.readonly)
- Ensure APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console

**3. AI summaries not working**
- Verify Gemini API key
- Check file format support (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Monitor API quotas

**4. Docker issues**
- Check port availability (5678)
- Verify environment variables
- Review container logs: `docker-compose logs n8n`

### Logs and Debugging

```bash
# View n8n logs
docker-compose logs -f n8n

# Check webhook responses
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/whatsapp-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Body": "HELP", "From": "whatsapp:+1234567890"}'
```

## 🚦 Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Send test messages to Twilio sandbox
2. Monitor n8n execution logs
3. Verify Google Drive operations
4. Check audit log in Google Sheets

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/whatsapp-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Body": "LIST /", "From": "whatsapp:+1234567890", "MessageSid": "test123"}'
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

The workflow automatically logs all activities to Google Sheets with:

- Timestamp
- User phone number
- Command executed
- Success/failure status
- Error messages

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Store in environment variables, never commit to code
- **Webhook Security**: Use webhook secrets for validation
- **Access Control**: Implement phone number whitelist
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with request throttling
- **Audit Trail**: All actions logged for compliance

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multi-file operations (bulk delete, move)
- [ ] Natural language parsing (e.g., "delete all old reports")
- [ ] File sharing with expiring links
- [ ] Integration with other cloud storage (Dropbox, OneDrive)
- [ ] Voice message support
- [ ] Rich media responses (images, videos)
